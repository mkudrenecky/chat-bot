# Chat-bot
An ongoing implementation of a command line and web-based chat bot.

## Details
This project leverages ChatterBot coupled with a customized training corpus to create a web-based chat bot. ChatterBot is a Python library that allows developers to create chatbots. It works by utilizing a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user input in a conversational manner.
